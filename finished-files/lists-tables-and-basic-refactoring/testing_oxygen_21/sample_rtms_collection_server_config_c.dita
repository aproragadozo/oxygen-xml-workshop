hardwireOperating system 
DL380p or BL460c Series server with the following configuration:2 x 8 core Gen8 CPU clocked at 2.6GHz or better64 GB or higher RAM6 x 1.2 TB 10K RPM Hard Disks configured in RAID 62 x 1 Gbps NIC cards
For BL460c series servers, the number of disks in a blade is limited. This limits the total number of nodes that can be monitored by RTMS unless complimented with a storage blade and/or a disk array, which is used for the database storage.
Virtual machines
Recommended configuration of VMs:20 vCPUs, 64 GB RAM and 1 TB ROM6 vCPUs, 32 GB RAM and 1 TB ROM4 vCPUs, 16 GB RAM and 1 TB ROM
Specification of servers used for creating VMs:hardwire Type: ProLiant DL380p Gen8Number of CPUâ€™s: 2CPU Type: Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2670 0 @ 2.60GHz with 8 CoresRAM: 128 GBHypervisor: ESXi 6.5
CPU locking is ensured in all the VM configuration.
IP requirementsFor HA deployment, two additional floating IPs are require for the following IPs:Virtual_IP - Used for pacemakerDelegate_IP - Used for database connection and replication
