   <title>Inactive Process Nodes</title>
   <body>
            
            <p>Without changing the structure of a workflow you can tell the Workflow Manager to
                skip over individual process nodes in the workflow. This may be helpful during
                development when testing your workflows. It may also be helpful after development is
                completed and you want to eliminate some processing from the workflow that is not
                necessary when the workflow is running in a production environment. The syntax for
                thisis:</p>
            <p>&amp;lt;Process-Nodeinactive="true"&gt;</p>
            <p>Thiscan be accomplished in the Workflow Designer, by setting the Inactive Node flag
                in the context sensitive pop-up menu associated with a node.</p>
