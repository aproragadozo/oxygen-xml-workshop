   <title>Test Process Nodes</title>
   <body>
            
            <p>Very similar to Inactive Procccess Nodes. The difference is that the process node is
                skipped if the parameter Test-Mode is set to false in the mwfm.xml configuration
                file and executed if set to true. The syntax for this is:</p>
            <p>&amp;lt;Process-Nodetest="true"&gt;</p>
            <p>Thiscan be accomplished in the Workflow Designer, by setting the Test Node flag in
                the context sensitive pop-up menu associated with a node.</p>
